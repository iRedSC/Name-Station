# Name-Station
A datapack that adds a little station that lets you rename items using Json formatting.

## How to Use
First you need to obtain a `Text Editor`, which you can do by finding it in an end city, simple dungeon, stronghold, or by giving it to yourself with
```mcfunction
function name_station:give
```
![text-editor](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/759159698921750558/759544926622711838/unknown.png)

Throw the `Text Editor` on a dropper and it will transform into a `Name Station`

## The GUI

There are two things you can edit with the name station, the item's `Name` and `Lore`. you can change it by clicking on the icon in the 2nd slot.

You can reset the `Name` or `Lore` by first selecting the correct type (seen above) and then clicking the `tnt minecart` in the 3rd slot

To set the item's `Name` or `Lore`, place a book in the 4th slot and an item in the 6th slot.
**Use a Signed Book for non-formatted text and a Book & Quill for formatted text**
